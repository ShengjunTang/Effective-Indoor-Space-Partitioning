This paper proposed an easily-used and robust method for indoor scenes partitioning from point clouds that integrates both 2D and 3D geometric features. During the vertical structure extraction process, this method fully leverages the distribution characteristics of point clouds in 2D space and the local and global features in 3D space, enabling robust extraction of vertical structural information in complex indoor environments.
